We're trying to provide a low-cost service to help athletics to grow.   Unfortunately, software development
and support are expensive to build and support in the early stages!  But once a service or aspect of the system runs smoothly,  it can keep doing so in the long term.  Our philosophy is that everyone has to pay a little...everything we earn for at least the next few years will be reinvested in the system.

## National contracts
We currently have contracts with Estonia, Malta, Cyprus, Wales (UK), Norway, Belarus and Serbia.   OpenTrack is generally free to use in those countries, when set up and managed by the relevant people in the national federation. If you are running a club event in one of these countries, please contact your national federation.


## Real Competitions - Entries Only
If you wish to use Opentrack to take entries, with fees on a credit card, we charge 50p + 5% on each transaction.   Out of this, approximately 20p + 1.5-2% goes to the card processing company.  So, on a £10.00 transaction, the club would receive £9.00; and we would make approximately 50-60p after costs and taxes

You will be able to number athletes and download the entry information in a spreadsheet.  You may also upload results AFTER the competition has finished.  

## Real Competitions - Competition Management

Using Opentrack end to end - with all features from entries through to seeding, live results, and score calculations - in the UK costs £1.00 + VAT (£1.20) per competitor.   We can either collect this from entry fees, or invoice.

Outside the UK, we charge 1 Euro per competitor, or a broadly equivalent amount in local currency, with no need to charge VAT.


## Virtual Competitions

The subsidy from England Athletics that allowed us to offer this free during COVID-19 ran from April to July.  Any virtual competition setbup in that time may keep running at no cost.  However, any new ones will be charged as above.
