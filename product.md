Please note that OpenTrack is still in early development - beware of bugs. 

# Product introduction

OpenTrack is an online system to handle your athletics event mangement and sign up, able to manage thousands of users. Our hosted database is browseable, searchable and supports various download and export formats.

We hope to provide one place that everyone in the sport can go to find information and browse results. Results are available in a desktop and mobile friendly format, as well as an automatically generated PDF. This makes it easier to complete and update race declarations online before or after the race. It can even be used to enter finish line information and quickly calculate the results. 

The flexible online entry system supports many types of athletics events such as team entries, relay teams. 

We organise event mangement around team managers or club secretaries (admins) and athletes (users). Individuals athletes can sign themselves or their friends for various athletics events. We check each athlete's EA number and payments for entries can be made through the site. Admins can create and manage events, and sign up their teams for events, saving them time, and giving validated data to race organisers.

## Open Source

In addition entries will be used to build up a database of athletes, with some data open, and other items as needed. This will be able to cross reference with other systems, such as Trinity, other NGBs and masters ranking sites. The database will also be crowdsourced, letting volunteers contribute local information.

We aim to have open reference data, with unique IDs, on athletic organisations and other race-organising bodies, as well as clubs and venues. 

## Open Libraries
We share useful building blocks for anyone building systems in the sport. This may include web front end elements, such as Javascript. We will set up a separate page of useful components. Data will also be made available in Github pages.

## Open Standards:  JSON and Excel
We will also suggest methods of representing the various packets of open data which could be stored and moved between systems:  clubs, membership lists, start lists, results of meetings. We will provide example files, and tools online to check their validity.

For each agreed JSON file format, we offer a common-sense Excel equivalent, so people can prepare data in a spreadsheet, paste it into a tool, and check its correctness.
 
## Results 
Our Race Results website will offer a standard format for results (in flavours for races, relays, and T&F), and a hosted results service. Anyone who wants to upload results can use a link to embed in their website as an IFrame.
