Please note that OpenTrack is still in early development, please beware of bugs. 

# Product introduction

Reportlab is developing several products for the athletics community. Our main product is OpenTrack, an online system to handle your athletics events. It can manage events and athlete sign up, being able to accomodate thousands of users. Race Results is our hosted database, it's browseable, searchable and supports various download and export formats.

Open Track includes features such as:

+ __Automatic England Athletics ID validations__: OpenTrack will automatically check if registered athletes have a valid England Athletics ID entered, against their database.

+ __Pay Intelligently__: OpenTrack lets team organisers and club secretaries enter and pay for any number of their own athletes on their behalf.

+ __Multiple Event Types Supported__: OpenTrack supports several different kinds of athletics events, such as standard races, relays and track and field events. 

+ __Athlete information can cross reference with other systems__: Including Trinity, other NGBs and masters ranking sites.

+ __Manage all events from OpenTrack__: After your athletes enter for an event, you can manage it from the same website. Input the results live and they can be seen from a mobile friendly web page. 

We organise event mangement around team managers or club secretaries (admins) and athletes (users). Admins can create and manage events, and sign up their teams for events, saving them time, and giving validated data to race organisers.

We also hope to provide one place that everyone in the sport can go to find information and browse results, through our related Race Results website. Results are available in a desktop and mobile friendly format, as well as an automatically generated PDF. This makes it easier to complete and update race declarations online before or after the race.

## Open Source

Making information open greatly benefits the sport and opens up possibilities to use the data to increase participation. 

The Race Results database will also be crowdsourced, letting volunteers contribute local information.

We also aim to have open reference data, with unique IDs, on athletic organisations and other race-organising bodies, as well as clubs and venues. 

## Open Libraries
We will share useful building blocks for anyone building systems. This may include web front end elements, such as Javascript. We will also set up a separate page of useful components. Data will also be made available in Github pages.

## Open Standards:  JSON and Excel
We will also suggest methods of representing the various packets of open data which could be stored and moved between systems:  clubs, membership lists, start lists, results of meetings. We will provide example files, and tools online to check their validity.

For each agreed JSON file format, we offer a common-sense Excel equivalent, so people can prepare data in a spreadsheet, paste it into a tool, and check its correctness.
 
## Results 
We offer a standard format for results (in flavours for races, relays, and T&F), and a hosted results service. We are working on being able to display live results. Anyone who wants to upload results can use a link to embed in their website as an IFrame.
