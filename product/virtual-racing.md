# The Isolation Age: Rise of Virtual Racing


With the country in lock-down and all sport, including athletics(?!) on hold, you could be forgiven for heading for a pit of despair; no group training, no banter, no competition!!! 

Fear not, because OpenTrack, alongside the sport's forever hard-working officials and volunteers, have got you covered ... VIRTUAL RACING.

Already in action from the 21st March, Thames, Hare & Hounds hosted a inter-club 5km race whilst Belgrave Harriers and Herne Hill Harriers hosted a virtual 12-Stage between them.
 
The Principle: Encourage participants to run the specified distance within a certain time-frame. Please note, that in these difficult times, we encourage you to not head out for your run during potentially busy periods. 

With the assistance of OpenTrack these races have the perfect platform to be hosted and displayed with attractive results alongside instantaneous scoring and Strava/Garmin route upload for quality checking . . . not that you canâ€™t be trusted!


OpenTrack are working to provide some fun new features to help facilitate this and are looking forward to hosting the first ever Virtual National 12 Stage Relay over the next week or so.

This provides an excellent opportunity for everyone to keep training hard to stay fit, maintain their competitive spirit and provides a fair few bored officials with something to do!
