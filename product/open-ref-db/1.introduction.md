## __1__ Introduction

We aim to provide an open, crowdsourced reference database to help different systems talk across the sport.

We’re giving unique IDs to the key things in the sport - Organisations, Venues, Competitions and People.    We already have over 6000 clubs, 5000 tracks, 2400 competitions and 34,000 people.   Everyone will be able to share our IDs.

We’re working on the mechanisms to let people claim their club, delegate responsibility to local volunteers and exports, review changes and keep the data quality high.
