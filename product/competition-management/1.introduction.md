## __1__ Introduction

The Competition Management System (CMS) allows meeting organisers to deal with the complexities of a full scale track and field match. It goes beyond Results Capture as it allows the complete management of the match. Volunteers spend less of their time entering data and athletes and spectators can view their results quickly. 

Despite being a new product, the CMS has successfully managed various events ranging from international athletics championships to local open meetings.
