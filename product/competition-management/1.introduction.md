## __1__ Introduction

The Competition Management system allows organisers to simply deal with the complexities of a full scale track and field match. It goes beyond Results Capture in that it allows the complete management of the match. Volunteers spend less of their time entering data and athletes and spectators can see their results quickly.

The system is in its first season but has successfully managed events ranging from international athletics championships down to open meetings.
