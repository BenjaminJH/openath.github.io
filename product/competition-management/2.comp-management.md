### 2.1 Why is it Required?

The CMS is a combination of <a href="/product/results-capture.html">Results Capture</a>, <a href="/product/entries-system.html">Entry System</a> and much more. Consequently the CMS provides a user-friendly, uniform platform to organise an athletics meeting. In keeping with all OpenTrack products, the aim and outcome of this is the provision of an improved experience for athletes, volunteers and spectators alike.
