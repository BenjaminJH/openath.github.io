## __2__ Competition Management 
	     
### 2.1 Full flexibility for the event organiser

We have a full management menu for the race organiser.

Using a simple hierarchical menu system all of the event details can be entered.

* Age group event limits
* Times of events
* Team competition set up
* Team scoring details
* Links between heats and finals
* Athlete Check in features

 
	      
### 2.2 Create a website for the match display

Using the results capture framework we allow complete customisation of venue, event list and athlete entry. 

* Bulk athlete load
* Full range of events covered


### 2.3 Number your athletes

One the athletes have been entered we can automatically allocate bib numbers, not only are these worn on the vests but they identify the athlete in the results. Most commonly used allocation algorithms are covered, we even cater for organisers using up some of last yearâ€™s numbers. Alternatively you can load yor pre-assigned bib-numbers with the athletes details.
  


### 2.4 Seed your athletes



Enter the Qualifying Performance and the athletes can be seeded either for championships or ranked open meetings. Manual override is available if too many athletes from one country are in the same heat.

We cover all the IAAF athletic events and can deal with the complexities of major competitions such as rounds, finals and multi-events.
