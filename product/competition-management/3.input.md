## __3__ Input the results

Using the same technology as results capture the results can be collated either manually or from photo-finish systems or even our live in-field recording.

The spectators benefit from live updates as the events unfold. If there is a team competition then the scores are continually updated. 

Field events become easier to follow, the 30 second between trials rule means that even at modern tracks the display boards do not show the distance covered for long. At stadia without those boards, the field events are difficult for even the hard core fans to follow.

Our system, using the live field inputting, stores each trial and fans can graphically see the rankings and historical distances of all the athletes as the competition evolves.


### 3.1 Status of results

_Why does the status matter?_ 

Results can be entered at any time, however they are only fully official when the match referee has approved them. It is important people understand the status of the results as they are looking at them. Events can exist in one of 3 states, each is colour coded on the display of the events.

1. In progress - the event has not finished (or perhaps even started yet)
2. Partial - results are not complete or have not been approved (yellow banner)
3. Complete - final results have been entered and approved.
