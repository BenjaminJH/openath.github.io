## __1__ The Isolation Age

With the country in lock-down and all sport, including athletics(?!) on hold, you could be forgiven for heading for a pit of despair; no group training, no banter, no competition!!!

Fear not, because OpenTrack, alongside the sport’s forever hard-working officials and volunteers, have got you covered … <i><b>VIRTUAL RACING</b></i>.

Already in action from the 21st March, Thames Hare & Hounds hosted a inter-club 5km race whilst Belgrave Harriers and Herne Hill Harriers hosted a virtual 12-Stage between them. On 4th April, the Virtual National Road Relay went ahead, getting 5000 entries. And from 22 April, we're opening our platform to the whole of the UK, thanks to support from the four Home Country Athletics Federation.  All over the world, races that would otherwise be cancelled are *going virtual*, hosted on OpenTrack.  


### 1.1 What is Virtual Racing?

Encourage participants to run the specified distance within a certain time-frame. Submit results from Garmin or Strava.  We work out all the team scores and rankings, and try to display it nicely.  You can see what everyone else did!

Please take care that in these difficult times, you avoid crowds and go out at quiet times.  Otherwise, you might get this new sport banned!

### 1.2 New Features, small changes

With the assistance of OpenTrack these races have the perfect platform to be hosted and displayed with attractive results alongside instantaneous scoring and Strava/Garmin route upload for quality checking . . . not that you can’t be trusted, but the club just behind you will want to check!

OpenTrack are working to provide some fun new features to help facilitate this and scale it up.  New features include:

 - Easily filter and find the Virtual Races on our platform
 - Specify the 'racing window'
 - Submit your own results easily with one copy/paste from Garmin or Strava
 - Charitable donation options on any race 
 - Competing at arbitrary challenges, not just distance running

### 1.2 Benefits for everyone!

This provides an excellent opportunity for everyone to keep training hard to stay fit, maintain their competitive spirit and provides a fair few bored officials with something to do!  

You're lucky to be able to run, so why not raise money for people suffering due to the virus?
