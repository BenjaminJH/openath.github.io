### 1.1 Results Capture System

The Results Capture system aims to display the results of athletics competitions online as fast as possible. 

### 1.2 Where this came from?

For years local athletics meetings have relied on manually inputted spreadsheets to be formulated for results display. Not only is this inefficient for meeting organisers but it also creates a poor spectator experience and can be frustrating for athletes. On a higher level, European Athletics centrally collects results from several hundred competitions across Europe. Meeting organisers send this data in various formats into Tilastopaja, European Athletics' statistics provider. The requirement for a more standardised system has been there for some time. 

OpenTrack can offer a low cost, public service for results collection and display to fill this market gap.
