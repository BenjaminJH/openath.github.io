### 2.2 Select your events

We cover all the IAAF athletic events and can deal with the complexities of major competitions such as rounds, finals and multi-events.

### 2.3 Entering competitors

Athletes can be entered singly or in a bulk paste from a spreadsheet.
Individual Entry Mode

__Bulk entry mode__ 

### 2.4 Inputting results

#### 2.4.1 Race results

__Manual entry__

Like a spreadsheet, type or paste we just format and check the data.

__Timing Systems__ 

Upload your results straight from FinishLynx or TimeTronics.

#### 2.4.2 Field Events

Enter from field card - we will rank athletes and do the data checks.

Or enter as the event is happening, use our recording screens for that live experience.

### 2.5 Status of results

__Why does the status matter?__

Results can be entered at any time, however they are only fully official when the match referee has approved them. It is important people understand the status of the results as they are looking at them. Events can exist in one of 3 states, each is colour coded on the display of the events.

1. In progress - the event has not finished (or perhaps even started yet)
2. Partial - results are not complete or have not been approved (yellow banner)
3. Complete - final results have been entered and approved.
