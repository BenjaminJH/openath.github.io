<p>Thanks to everyone who came around to our office tonight!  We hope to make this regular.</p>

<p>In attendance, with a brief bio and summary of interests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Andy Robinson, ReportLab’s MD</li>
  <li>Ricardo Mendonca, ReportLab’s lead developer</li>
  <li>Gus Upton, Belgrave XC Captain, who has helped OpenTrack with marketing over the summer</li>
  <li>Andy Weir, on sabbatical from a bond fund management career, currently serving as “Special Projects Director”</li>
  <li>Bilen Ahmet, multi-events specialist at Kingston &amp; Poly, C/C++/Rust/Python/JS developer, and using JSON-schema at work</li>
  <li>Richard Kirk, 26.2 RRC (and doing results for next week’s Div 3/4 Surrey League): many years working on back end financial calculators for banks, keen to learn about front end technologies and new languages, and get age grades built into their site</li>
  <li>Allan Whatmough, Ranelagh member and Django developer - formerly worked for ReportLab - just completed(?) a data analytics MSC and keen to put this to work</li>
  <li>Tom Conlon, Herne Hill ex-membership secretary - runs a firm building HR systems, experience with Vue.js, websockets and node.js</li>
</ul>

<p>We agreed that a key goal is to push forwards the <a href="https://github.com/openath/athlib/">athlib</a> library to contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample JSON files in our proposed new formats to describe cross-country, track and field and multi-events competitions</li>
  <li>JSON schemas to validate them</li>
  <li>age grade tables and corresponding calculation code</li>
  <li>multi events scoring (already there)</li>
</ul>

<p>It also needs to be packaged to be testable and deployable via “npm install”, preferably while we only have one or two functions.  Tom’s our guru on this.</p>

<p>We resolved to meet again on Wednesday 30th November.   Next time I’ll make sure we have more space, and sort out the all-important FOOD!</p>

<p>Other actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><i>fix the damned CSS on this page, so that lists look like the body text ;-)</i></p>
  </li>
  <li>set up a Slack project or channel for short term chat</li>
  <li>ping Slack whenever Github is updated</li>
  <li>try Github for issues and tasks (it’s got a lot better recently)</li>
  <li>start talking on the forum wherever possible</li>
  <li>start workin on parsing WMA results (Allan?)</li>
  <li>start working on Age Grade factors and code (Richard?)</li>
</ul>

<p>On a followup note, we should shortly have sample files in other formats which we can play with for..</p>

<ul>
  <li>the complete Rio 2016 athletics results</li>
  <li>World Masters Athletics - 2013, 2015 and 2016</li>
  <li>Surrey League XC, of course</li>
  <li>a few local fun runs</li>
</ul>

<p>Once some draft schema exists, we can start to play around.  This website can provide a home for any “static” experiments.</p>
