<p>We did our first tests of the standalone OpenTrack system at the Thames

<p>We’d previously tried out our back end API at the last Surrey League race on 14th February, and learned a lot of lessons.  The changes this time were…</p>

<ul>
  <li>a custom HTML keypad with bigger buttons than the normal iPhone dialogs</li>
  <li>gloves and styluses, to prevent freezing fingers</li>
  <li>separate modes for recorders and timekeepers</li>
</ul>

<p>Things went well on the recording at the back of the funnel.  The challenges were fairly mundane:  a lack of pins resulted in many people with flapping numbers, and we only had two people on the funnel.</p>

<p>We also shot a finish line video using a GoPro-style camera.</p>
