#Call for volunteers

We have taken on a lot, and are looking for help at all levels.  If you love athletics, and have some relevant skills and spare time, we welcome offers of help.

##Web and Graphic Design
As you can tell, we could immediately use some help creating a strong brand, with a  good logo and certain other assets.  The logo needs to tell anyone that this is about changing the sport through advanced technology.

We plan to offer some very attractive, visual results services so there is work to do creating reusable stylesheets.

##Writers
We can always use people willing to write documentation:  how-to guides with screenshots, FAQs and so on.

##API and Standards Design
If you have experience of creating APIs that worked in the real world, or of standards-forming processes, please let us know.  We have to set standards at a "common sense" level that will work for people in the sport (i.e. columns and fields to use in spreadsheets), as well as in terms of JSON documents with validation.

##Data scientists
We aim to build big databases on clean foundations, and will be producing data sets which are available for research because they are labelled as Open Data from the start

##Back end developers: Python, Django, MySQL and MOngo
Our platform is likely to involve Django, Mongo, ReST APIs and OAuth2.  To date we have been Django developers, but we aim to decouple front and back ends.

##Front end developers
If you know all about bower, grunt, minification and the like, and can build easy-to-user interfaces which talk to ReST APIs, we want to hear from you.

As part of the FIWARE project, We aim to build next-generation components using Google Polymer, to make it easier to plug together systems down the road. Web Components should make it possible to build reusable 'club pickers', data input fields that understand times or distances and so on.  However, Polymer won't yet work in all browsers, so we're doing plenty with good old Bootstrap and JQuery.

##Meteor
If anyone knows their way around the Meteor framework, we'd love to talk.  Nothing could be better for real-time event management.
