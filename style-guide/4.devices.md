## __4__ Devices

Opentrack stylesheets and digital assets support displaying product screenshots directly in visuals of key devices. Currently we support __Smartphone__, __tablet__ and __browser__ screenshots which are easily displayed on the website by using the standard code template. 


### 4.1 Screenshot dimensions 

For best presentation it is recommended that all screenshots conform to the advised aspect ratio / sizes. The dimensions given are minimum requirements, however it is recommended to double these dimensions to maintain crisp display on retina devices.

1. Mobile phone: 192px x 343px
2. Tablet: 430px x 322px
3. Browser: 728px x 485px

These devices can be specified to display on the left or right side or in the middle of the page. They will automatically resize responsively with side images repositioning into the centre of the page on smaller screens.
