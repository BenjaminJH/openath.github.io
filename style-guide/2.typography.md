### 2.1 Typefaces

Main typeface we use is Proxima Soft, this is a [premium typeface by Mark Simonson](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-soft) available through [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-soft) and [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-soft/regular/). 

If creating documentation or apps where this typeface is not available then you may use the similar Google font [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito/).

### 2.3 Headings

The templates support the full range of header style:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4


These can be written in markdown, and if it is desired to pull a number from a heading 2 tag (H2), as can be seen in the section title above, wrap the number in `<strong>` tags. eg:  
* html :  `<h2><strong>2</strong> Typography</h2>`  
* markdown :  `## __2__ Typography`


	      
### 2.4 Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used on the website and styled to highlight the text, they pair well with p and h3 tags and you should include the quotation marks as these are offset on the first line. If writing quotes in Markdown, it is necessary to include the source of the quote on a new line within `<small>` html tags.
