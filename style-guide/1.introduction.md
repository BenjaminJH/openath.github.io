## __1__ Introduction

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/). Opentrack use design patterns and components from these libraries which should be understood so that they can be effectively implimented when needed.

Wherever feasible we have allowed content to be written in [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), especially for content such as documentation and news, that we hope will be team supported. There are pages requiring complex formatting however where we have used HTML markup.
