## __1__ Introduction

This website is built with Jekyll using Bootstrap 4, there a number of design patterns and components that are repeated throughout which should be understood so that they can be effectively replicated.

Wherever feasible we have allowed content to be written in Markdown, especially for content, such as documentation and news, that we hope will be team supported. There are areas where we have to use HTML markup however.
