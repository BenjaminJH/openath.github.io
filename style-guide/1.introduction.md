## __1__ Introduction

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and the documentation on these websites is relevant to this website. There are a number of design patterns and components that are repeated throughout the website which should be understood so that they can be effectively replicated when needed, this page is an attempt to record these.

Wherever feasible we have allowed content to be written in [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), especially for content, such as documentation and news, that we hope will be team supported. There are areas with complex formatting where we have to use HTML markup however.
