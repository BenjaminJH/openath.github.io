## __2__ Typography 

### 2.1 Typefaces

Main typeface we use is Proxima Soft, this is a [premium typeface by Mark Simonson](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-soft) available through [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-soft) and [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-soft/regular/). 

If creating documentation or apps where this typeface is not available then you may use the similar Google font [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito/).

### 2.3 Headings

The templates support the full range of header style:

# Heading 1 is for main page title
## Heading 2 is used to title page sections
### Heading 3 is for section subtitles 
#### Heading 4 is good for small blocks of content


These headings can all be written in markdown, and if it is desired to pull a number from a h2 tag as can be seen in the section titles in this page, all that is necessary is to wrap the number in `<strong>` tags. eg:  

* html :  `<h2><strong>2</strong> Typography</h2>`  
* markdown :  `## __2__ Typography`


	      
### 2.4 Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used on the website and styled to highlight the text, they pair well with p and h3 tags and you should include the quotation marks as these are offset on the first line. If writing quotes in Markdown, it is necessary to include the source of the quote on a new line within `<small>` html tags, for example:  

```
> “This is a quote automatically paragraphed from Markdown”  
    <small>Source of the quote</small>
```

> “This is a quote automatically paragraphed from Markdown”  
<small>Source of the quote</small>
