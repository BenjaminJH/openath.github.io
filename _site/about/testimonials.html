"Reportlab really understand their technology and have followed the principles of good system, process and data design in the development of "OpenTrack".  It has established data repositories of clubs and athletes, which are now being used for multiple applications in membership and competition management and the design is extendible to other European countries and more applications in grassroots athletics of use to national governing bodies, race organisers and athletics clubs. Moreover, Reportlab responded very quickly to our request to get the first version of the system into operation ready by the beginning of the year.  The startup was carefully phased and each development tested in a separate environment so that we did not have major data hiccups or too many urgent fixes to system problems."

  Subject: Re: Reportlab and BMAF OpenTrack</p>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>

<p>The feedback I am getting from Southern Counties Veterans members is increasingly positive, as pieces of functionality get added to the new BMAF membership management and competition entries system.</p>

<p>Once a new member has entered his or her details, they are remarking how easy it is to enter competitions, see which new fixtures are coming up, and check on the entries in their chosen event.</p>

<p>The only delays revolve around human intervention, e.g. waiting for membership secretaries to move them from Pending status to Confirmed status, or having their EA registration number checked for validity.</p>

<p>In short, Reportlab are doing a great job for BMAF and the Area Masters Clubs!</p>

<p>Best Wishes</p>

<p>Dave Beattie</p>

<p>Road Running Secretary, Southern Counties Veterans AC.</p>

"Developing an athlete-proof system (a far higher standard than <i>idiot-proof!</i>) is the stated aim and even though we are not yet there, many techno-phobes and older athletes inexperienced with computers, find the system quick and easy for their use, once they have understood the access process, and grasped the complexity of masters athletics"

"Being a member of OpenTrack has made entering Masters' competitions
much easier. Seeing what's coming up and getting good information has
encouraged me to enter events, especially as the online payment system
is quick and efficient. It's also great to be able to check who else has
entered. Paying my annual membership subscription through the same
account, and being sure that my personal details are correct, are other
valuable features."

<blockquote><p>
"As a Team Manager of my club's Men's and Women's teams in the Surrey
Cross Country leagues, my volunteer job has been made much easier by
Reportlab's online registration and declaration system. I can do all the
data entry from my laptop or phone, in advance. I can make changes
quickly. No more hanging around on race-day wondering whether runners
will turn up, then declaring them on scruffy paper sheets. The system is
open and transparent, the results come out sooner and are much more
accurate. I think this professional approach encourages people to
participate and also to volunteer for official roles. Maggie Statham,
Team Manager for Holland Sports AC Men's and Women's Cross Country teams
in the Surrey Cross Country League."

From the perspective of a team manager of a division 4 club I have been really impressed with the new system and think it is very simple to use. (but I'm not compiling the scores). Hopefully gone are the days of completing declaration sheets in the wind and rain on a soggy piece of paper. Its so much easier doing the declarations by smart phone... it's a great step forward.

<p>Starting the “standards process” on our behalf::</p>

<p>Dean Hardman <a href="mailto:dhardman@englandathletics.org">dhardman@englandathletics.org</a>
  1 Feb</p>

<p>to me, simon.fennell, terryjdixon, peter, Alan, webmaster, glen
  Dear all</p>

<p>Apologies for the “cold call”. My name is Dean and I work for England
  Athletics. I know many of you from various other roles (British Athletics
  League Chair, Sale Harriers Manchester team manager), but in this
  instance, with my EA hat on, I wanted to get in touch regarding results
  programmes and entry systems.</p>

<p>In recent months we have been corresponding with Andy Robinson (copied) of
  Report Lab, who provides a results service for Cross Country events in the
  Surrey area. Andy has also been working closely with the British Masters
  Athletics Federation on their entry systems and results programmes.</p>

<p>Andy and Report Lab have an interest in open data and sharing of best
  practice and to that end have been working on a project called OpenTrack
  (http://opentrack.run/), which is all about collaborating with each other
  to improve systems.</p>

<p>From an EA perspective, we encourage anything that has the potential to
  make the sport better and the lives easier for volunteers. I have
  therefore copied people into this email who I know have an interest in
  results and entry systems or who act as competition providers. Having
  spoken to Andy, we thought that there may be an opportunity for a virtual
  discussion on these topics. There is no obligation (it goes without
  saying) on anyone to be part of this discussion and certainly no
  expectation that any of you will actually have to do anything, but if
  having a chat helps to improve each other’s approaches etc. then all the
  better. I’m sure Andy will be able to explain more.</p>

<p>If you feel that I have missed anyone off of this list, please add them to
  any reply you wish to make. I am conscious that Tim Grose would be a good
  person, for example. Similarly, if it is felt that EA IT could make any
  useful input, I can facilitate that.</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Dean</p>

  England Athletics
  Head of Business Development and Communications</p>
