<a href="/product/federation-admin.html/">Federation Management</a> is the system designed for federations to look after all aspects of their nation's athetics, such as setting up championships, approving licesnes, assigning coaches etc. 

### 2.1 Competitor Lists

Within Federation Management, nations can upload their entire athlete database to quickly locate athletes, often using a unique ID, to action things such as finding their season rankings, enter them into competitions, and move them between clubs. 

These can be displayed in multiple languages, importantly in the language and alphabet of the host nation, as shown below with Cyprus.
