## __1__ Introduction

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/). Design patterns and components from these libraries should be understood when the website is being updated so that they can be effectively implemented when needed.

Wherever feasible we have allowed content to be written in [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), especially for content such as documentation and news, that we hope will be team supported. There are pages requiring complex formatting however where we have used HTML markup.

This website is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com), the [master repository can be viewed here](https://github.com/openath/openath.github.io).
