# Stripe Tutorial



If you are new to Stripe this tutorial will help you set up an account. Stripe provides an online payment infrastructure. We use it to accept and transfer funds, and it will be necessary to set up an account if you wish to use the OpenTrack system.

<br>

<br>

First, go to [stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com) on your web browser. You will see the above screenshot. Click on the signup button to be taken to a page where you can create your account. Note that sometimes in order to make this slide appear, you will need to cycle through the slides on this page, by clicking on the arrows that will appear on the left and right borders. 

<br>

<br>

You will be taken to a signup page. You can preview stripe and and get comfortable with the settings by clicking on the ‘skip this step’ link. However you will not be able to change some account settings without creating an account. When you’re happy, you can save your account afterwards.

 Once you have made an account or have decided to preview stripe, you will be immediately taken to the dashboard page which looks like the above screenshot. This page displays financial information to you. You can click on the various buttons on the left hand column to see how Stripe will display information on customers, payments and other features to you. Once you have familiarized yourself with the dashboard, we will now need to set up your account settings, click on ‘Your Account’ on the top right of the page, and then ‘Account Settings’. 

Stripe Account settings
------

The window in the screenshot above should pop up. If you have not created an account, you will not be able to view all the tabs in this page.

There are other tabs which you will not need to use right now, but are helpful to know about if you wish to use Stripe in the future, the email tab lets you tweak emails you send to your customers and the subscriptions tab lets you set subscription dates and rates for anything you may wish to sell. 

The first thing is to link our ReportLab account with yours. To do this first click on the ‘team’ tab. On the ‘team’ tab you should see yourself as an administrator.  Please invite your contact at ReportLab (see screen shot below) and we can then help to finish the setup. You should also invite another club member or two - for example, the club treasurer and/or a programmer on your club if there is one.

Let ReportLab copy API Keys
------

If you already have an account, and don’t want to invite us to share the account, you will have to copy and send us what are called API keys. This is in order to let us connect our system to yours and send you money.  You can do this by clicking on the “API Keys” tab. Note: they are confidential.

In the future we’ll provide a place for you to paste these into our system, but we have not got there yet.

If you think someone else has learned the secret API keys, let us know, and they can be reset to new values by clicking the little circle icon.  Naturally, we did this after taking the below screenshot!

Configure bank account and transfer frequency
------

The ‘Transfers’ tab is where you put your bank account and sort code.
By default, Stripe will transfer money seven days after they receive it.  With a typical Open Meeting, you will then end up with an annoying small entry on your bank statement every day for 4-6 weeks.  In order to avoid this, we suggest you change the frequency to Monthly or Weekly, or even “Manual Transfers” which will let you control it.

There are some additional things you can do with Stripe at this point, because Stripe is very friendly for programmers. If you have a web developer in your club you will find it easy to do other things such as:

+ Sell things from your club web site by creating buttons
+ Sell recurring payments - e.g. quarterly courses or blocks for kids
+ Take membership payments automatically

<br>

Taking a manual charge
------

You can also manually charge someone’s credit card over the phone or in person.
On the Payments tab, hit “New Payment”:

<br>

This leads to a screen like this:

<img src="/img/stripe-tutorial/create-a-new-payment-form.png" style="width:300px;">

Enter the relevant details and when you’re ready click on ‘create payment’. You can then take money from anyone, over the phone or in person at a competition. OpenTrack won’t know anything about it. 

Similarly, clicking in the ‘Transfers’ button will bring you to an almost identical screen that will let you transfer money to your bank account, simply click ‘create new transfer’. This screen will pop up:

<img src="/img/stripe-tutorial/create-a-new-transfer-form.png" style="width:300px;">

Simply enter in the amount, description and statement description and click ‘create transfer’. 

You can set up your bank account on the ‘transfers’ tab in ‘account settings’. Simply click on ‘Add Bank Account’, where you can enter in your details. This page will also let you change your transfer schedule.
