# Data

Not only do we think everyone should be able to decode athletics data, we believe they should have access to it as well. The benefit of being able to easily exchange data means that everyone will have an incentive to work together, which benefits everyone involved in the sport in the long run. Making the data available to all allows all interested people to view or even better build code to make it more visible to a wider public.
