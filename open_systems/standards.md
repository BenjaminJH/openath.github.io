# Standards

Currently results are transmitted in many ways, normally with no common standard so the data from each provider has to be analysed separately. The major games obviously have put a lot of time and effort into determining standards, however the standard is way too bulky for day to day matches.  Hence, we have joined up with the world wide web consortium to develop a standard, that can completely describe athletics features but is not too huge and cumbersome
 
Data Standards may sound like an academic exercise that only interests computer scientists. However, with a common standard for the transmission of athletics data everyone benefits.

- Faster/more accurate results
    - No more parsing or results files
- Cheaper code
    - All systems know how data is arriving and being sent, which saves time on writing new modules
