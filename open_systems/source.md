# Source

OpenSource - the open source athlib library. We have started making some of our code available to all. There is no need for multiple Age Group methods to be written across the globe. Our experience of OpenSource projects has taught us that high quality and innovative code can result. Have a look at [some examples](https://athlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), feel free to use it or [add your own](/volunteer/) functions. If you live in South West London come and attend our user group forum.
