## Signing up to Opentrack

Thanks for your interest in OpenTrack's entry system.  We are preparing for a wider launch in October.

We charge a one-off organisational setup fee of £100 plus VAT. We will invoice you for this and you can pay via BACS. We then deduct 50p + 5% from each credit card transaction to cover the costs of the online payment system. So if someone pays £10.00 then you will receive £9.00 direct into your bank account. 

We will then set up the first competition for you to test out. For this we will need a programme or short document from you clearly setting out the event, price, date, location, and any promotional text you want. If you have a paper entry form, that will do fine. Once set up, you will have your own administration screen for creating and modifying your competitions.
