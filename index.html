      <h2>A complete athletics competition management suite</h2>

      <p>Athletes want to run, jump and throw. Yet the sport is limited by a number of volunteers doing a lot of manual work. They spend far too much time moving around facts and checking them - entries, start lists, membership info. Let's reduce this burden and bring athletics into the 21st century, using our easy-to-implement and easy-to-use race management system. Let's make everything go faster!</p>  

      <p>Athletes will enjoy the benefits of our service with easier entries into races, secure online payments and instant results on their mobile devices.</p>
