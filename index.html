<h2>OpenTrack: Open Data, Open Standards and Open Source in Athletics</h2>

<p>The OpenTrack project aims to make it easier than ever to organise events in athletics - including cross country and relays. Road races are well served, but the inter-club and inter-school events which are the lifeblood of the sport are organised by spreadsheets.  The systems which exist are often maintained by single individuals.  </p>  

<p>In a modern, networked environment, we believe we can do much better: making it easier to set up, enter and manage events, and to publish and receive the results.  We can save officials time, and make things more enjoyable for the athletes.</p>

<p>We have been fortunate to secure European Union technology funding under the FINODEX project to start development in the 2015-16 season.  The pilot projects are taking place in Surrey, working with the local cross country league and county association.  But our ambitions are global.</p>

<p>There are three pillars to our plans:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Open Data</dt>
    <dd>Everyone can benefit from standardising the reference data in the sport:  agreeing codes and IDs for clubs, venues, organising bodies and so on, and being able to identify individual athletes.  We believe that the results of sporting events, as facts,  should carry an open data license.</dd>

    <dt>Open Standards</dt>
    <dd>We aim to define and agree open standards for exchanging membership info, start lists and results for various kinds of meetings.  Anyone building systems for "one part of the puzzle" can interact with others</dd>

    <dt>Open Source</dt>
    <dd>Where possible, we should share code and solutions across the sport, to make it easier for anyone to build high quality athletics systems.  While events and leagues will probably always need tobuild their own, they can use common building blocks.</dd>
