        <h2>An information strategy for the sport...</h2>
        <p>Everyone wants to run, jump and throw.  Yet the sport is limited by a number of volunteers.
        They spend far too much time moving around facts and checking them - entries, start lists,
        membership info.  We can reduce this burden, and let them spend the time doing more valuable
        things - coaching, and running events</p>
        <p>Athletes will enjoy things more when they can follow results quickly and easily</p>
