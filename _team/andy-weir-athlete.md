I have run since school and have held most committee posts at my running club, Thames Hare and Hounds. Having run on track and cross country for university and club, I progressed to British Students and Regional teams. I was a key member of the Thames team that won the London Marathon Team Championship 5 times. These days age forces me to set my targets lower but I am the current South of England M50 Cross Country Champion. I am a qualified assistant coach and help with my daughters U15 middle distance squad as well as helping officiate at local Open Athletics Meetings.

I am happy to work with OpenTrack as it combines my interest in data, in all its forms, and my love of athletics. Having been involved in the volunteer end of the sport I strongly believe in helping the officials on the ground through improved technology and systems.
