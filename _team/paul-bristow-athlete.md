A former county level athlete and University captain, Paul participates regularly in his local ParkRun and completed his first ever marathon in 2016!  He is still actively engaged in grass roots sport as a coach for the local U10 Rugby team.
 
Paul is very excited to serve as a Director on the OpenTrack Board, which brings together his personal and professional experience over the last 30 years into a project for the benefit of sport from the grass roots to the elite level.  Paul said, “I grew up in an athletics family and my mother spent 30 years handwriting the results at matches for Brighton and Hove Athletics Club, so I know how valuable the OpenTrack products are for both athletes and officials at all levels within the sport.   My mother would have loved it as much as I do!”
