Feature Roadmap
-------------
We are not promising any particular dates, but are working to deliver the features below during 2017.  They will be rolled out to all of our users as they are developed and tested.


 1. Set up new competitions yourself
 2. A newer "club picker" which can handle
   * unattached athletes, if the competition allows them
   * select from UKA-affiliated clubs (1800 in UK);
   * select from all known running clubs and schools (3000+ in UK)
   * select from a specific list of clubs/teams provided by the organiser
 
 3. A smarter license checker, which can check English/Welsh registered athletes as we do now, but also "park" ones from Scotland, Northern Ireland or overseas for you to review - at least until UKA provides a national system
 3. Allow you to fully edit and adjust any individual entry, either before it has been paid (if the person entering needs help) or afterwards
 4. a "bulk entry" option with a spreadsheet interface, useful for coaches or club admins who want to enter large numbers at once
 5. alllow you to issue refunds, at your discretion.   (This is quite a bit of work, and until we have done it, we can do it for you on receipt of an email)
 6. provide additional (paid) services for programme and race number layout and printing
 7. provide social media features to help promote entries


 8. A dedicated road relay entry process with 2 or 3 phases
   * pay for the right number of teams at the outset
   * if required, declare the "squad" online in advance
   * let the team manager say who's running which leg in which team, on the day, with mobile devices
 9. A dedicated track and field "team sheet"
 10. A high-speed "entry on the day" screen for meeting organisers, so that late entries can be put into the same start lists.
