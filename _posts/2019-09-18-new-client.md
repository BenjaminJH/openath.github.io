On the eve of the World Championships, OpenTrack are proud to announce some other athletics related news. Whilst the excitement of Doha is palpable, the general day-to-day of athletics must continue. Adding to our growing list of clienetele, we are now pleased to declare that Norway have signed on to use the OpenTrack platform for all their Federation & Competition Management requirements. In a quick turnaround of discussions, an agreement has been swiftly made to suit all parties and build a lasting relationship moving forward.
