Dynamic New Athletics is a new and exciting athletics team competition format proposed by European Athletics. It will be held between national teams from Europe at the European Games in Minsk, Belarus in 2019.  It’s also designed to be fun and accessible for clubs, and will be promoted in Europe next summer.

We're helping organise the first ever competition THIS WEEKEND in Wimbledon, between local clubs and athletes, at Wimbledon Park.

We're looking for some more athletes to take part
 - try out the new events and see how well they work
 - get film footage to explain it to the world
 - learn how to organise and manage the competition

You'll take part in a number of traditional events and relays over a period of about hours.  

We'll pay £10 to the first 40 athletes top sign up (and turn up!) on Saturday, and £20.00 on Sunday.  However, most of all, you will be among the very first to try out something new in the sport.

Under 18s will need a signed note from a parent or guardian giving permission for filming.
