Dynamic New Athletics is a new and exciting athletics team competition format proposed by European Athletics. It will be held between national teams from Europe at the European Games in Minsk, Belarus in 2019.  It’s also designed to be fun and accessible for clubs, and will be promoted in Europe next summer.

We're helping organise the first ever competition THIS WEEKEND in Wimbledon, between local clubs and athletes, at Wimbledon Park.  The goals of the event are
 - try out the new events and see how well they work
 - get film footage to explain it to the world
 - for officials to learn how to organise and manage the competition 


We're looking for some more athletes (U15 and above) to take part.  You'll do a few events over 2-3 hours.  We'll do a dress rehearsal on Saturday, and aim for a full "match" on Sunday in 2 hours.  Full details are in <a href="http://file.opentrack.run/docs/2017/dna/dna_guide_v3.pdf">the guide</a>


We'll pay £10 to the first 40 athletes to sign up (and turn up!) on Saturday, and £20 on Sunday.  However, most of all, you will be among the very first to try out something new in the sport.
