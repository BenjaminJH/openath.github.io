title: Spring is in the air, and it can only mean one thing...the County Championships
author: Andy Weir

We worked with six counties this year in the lead up to their biggest events of the year. More than 3,000 athletes entered through our system; which showed itself up to the task. More importantly, hundreds of volunteer-hours were saved across the country.

The biggest boon for the organisers was how we helped with the data. We offered automatic field cards, seeding lists, programme generation and even race number printing. The athletes loved their unique numbers; they even had their events and start-times listed on the bottom - no excuses for being late.
