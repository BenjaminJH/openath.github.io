We are pleased to anounce that Norway have signed on to adopt the OpenTrack platform for all their Federation & Competition Management requirements.   The solution will handle athlete licensing, team and individual entries, and capture of results, and will progressively be made available to every club and competition in Norway at no extra cost.

Andy Robinson, OpenTrack Founder said "This is the culmination of an exciting summer, and we are delighted to be serving one of Europe's most successful athletics federations. We cannot wait to get started!"

Good luck to all the athletes competing in Doha! Here's to an Ingebrigtsen 1, 2, 3!
