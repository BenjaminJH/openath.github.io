Our sport lost a great leader at the weekend.  We got to know Svein through our work with European Athletics, presenting to him and the board in Belgrade in March 2017, attending the Convention in Vilnius 2017 and in Lausanne 2018, the Berlin championships, and a few other events in between.  From the beginnng it was immediately evident, from the first hours at one of these events, what a happy family and a well-functioning organisation he had built at European Athletics under his presidency, with 50 countries all pulling in the same direction.  He was very supportive of our plans to modernise things at a digital level, although he did keep asking Bill Glad to explain it to him again!  He will be sorely missed in the athletics world...
