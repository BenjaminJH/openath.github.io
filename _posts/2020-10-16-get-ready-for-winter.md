This winter promises to be like none before it, with unprecedented difficulties affecting our lives. We at OpenTrack have been working around the clock to ensure athletics can continue to move forward so those hard, solo training sessions will not be wasted, and you can keep all your club members engaged. 

OpenTrack has been in the vanguard of virtual racing, building the systems from scratch and providing a platform for competitive action of some sort during those taxing (ðŸ˜‰) lockdown months. Having launched our virtual platform in March, we received funding from the four Home Country Athletics Federations, enabling us to offer virtual races to all clubs in the UK from April until today.

This is where many of you will know us from, potentially from the initial Virtual National Road Relay or maybe an event hosted by your own club. However, while virtual racing was new to us too, normal athletics and XC are our bread and butter; we have been taking entries and providing the systems to manage competitions for years. These include multiple international events, such as the 10,000m European Cup (aka Highgateâ€™s Night of 10,000m PBs), and various county championships each year. Events range from simple fun runs and school XC races up to complex multi-day track and field meetings - whatever the event, we can support and assist with it!

## Organising an Event

As an organiser of a competition, the first point of call for up to date information should always be the federation websites. For example, in England, EA have produced Cross Country Return to Restricted Competition Guidance  (link to web page not PDF)
