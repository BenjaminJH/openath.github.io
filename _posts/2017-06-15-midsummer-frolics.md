Thames Parkland Relays saw 100 teams compete on a beautiful evening in Richmond Park. The course is a classic, each 2.8 mile leg going round Spankers Hill wood, past the ballot school, up the Queenâ€™s Ride and back home via Penn Ponds. 

Relays are a lot of fun, however they are horrific to organise and calculate the results. The handovers are a "zoo" On leg 1, 200 athletes handed over to each other within a few minutes, whilst officials tried to record the melee.

Andy Greenleaf recorded the fastest leg of the day

OpenTrack took the entries which sold out within two weeks and debuted our new relay team selection module. Team captains could select the members of their pre-entered teams on the night, or even change the order in the park if the 18:10 from Clapham was delayed. On the results side, we set up 2 recording teams using our mobile phone app with a paper and pen back up. The accuracy was remarkable and having the names and leg order stored electronically meant we could announce the <a href="https://opentrack.info/c/2017parklandrelays/relay/finish/" >results</a> in the pub well before last orders. If you are interested in our relay solutions please do get in touch.

On the day Thames won overall for men and women and also the vets men. A strong trio of Hercules Women won the vets prize. Nottingham University Old Boys kept up their strong tradition in this event with a second place overall and the fastest leg of the day from Andy Greenleaf (pictured). Though clearly it was the NOBs second leg runner that made the difference.
