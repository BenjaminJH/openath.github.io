Thames Hare and Hounds hosted the annual Varsity Match on Wimbledon Common. Nothing new in that, but this year we had splits from round 
the course relayed back to the club house. 

The Thames course is a single lapper so unless you have a reasonable turn of speed spectating involves waiting for the athletes
to come back 40 minutes after the gun goes off. Using our mobile phone technology we could track the pulsating men's race as the lead switched from Cambridge to Oxford.
