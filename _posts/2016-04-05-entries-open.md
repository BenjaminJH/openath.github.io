As the nights draw shorter and the days warmer, the winter athletics season is certainly coming to a close; the tartan track beckons!

Fortunately some of the best season-opening events, namely the County Championships, have already started their entry process, and OpenTrack is proud to offer all the online entries for the Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Middlesex & Bedfordshire Championships. 

These athletic meets are some of the first where our new system can truly be unveiled and we are proud to start with such prestigious events that contain some of the biggest and best athletics clubs and athletes in the country. 

With a wave of keen athletes making the most of the live online service on just the first night of opening, it is hopeful that we can help to surpass the great number of athletes these events boasted in 2015. 

To get in early and secure your entry head to:  raceresults.reportlab.com/entries

In the meantime, just to whet your appetite, here are some nice shots of how our mobile service looks!
