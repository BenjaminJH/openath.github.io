We've been asked to publicise a proposed rule change for county eligibility.  The deadline for comments is July 20th.  

Leighton Buzzard AC and Bedfordshire AAA have suggested that one be allowed to compete for a county by belonging to a club registered in that county, in addition to qualification by birth or residence. The reasons are set out in this short document:

We're in support of this for two reasons.  First of all, it can only increase participation, encouraging clubs on county boundaries to turn out in force.  Secondly, it will reduce the administration burden, because it's easy to check.   

We've helped six counties manage their entries and prepare for their championships this May, saving many man-days in the preparation process.  We hope to do the same for more counties next season, and we have a pretty good idea by now where time goes and what creates headaches.

Club membership is generally well known.  We're working to get it accepted that this is actually Open Data; we think everyone should be able to see who's registered with which club, not just the membership secretary, because this (in addition to your age group) is the basic data which the sport needs to function.  In many countries, like Spain, or Estonia ([which we manage](https://estonia.opentrack.run/)), the federation web site shows who all the members of all the clubs are in a given season.

So, if this rule was adopted, we could quickly assemble an open public registry of which clubs were afiliated with which counties; and we'd be able to "clear" the vast majority of athletes as eligible AS THEY ENTERED.  

Right now, when an athlete enters a county championships, we are forced to ask them "are you qualified by residence, or birth?".  Many of them answer "both", and we get into semantics because that option wasn't available on the paper forms (apparently you're supposed to say *birth* if it's both).  Verification is impractical because athletics officials cannot easily visit a registry office a thousand times, nor can they tell if someone borrows a postcode. We're also uncomfortable collecting data on home addresses; it's sensitive personal data, and the less of that we can collect, the better.

It's a safe bet that 90% of the athletes will be a member of a club in the county.  So that's the default approach.  In fact, we don't even need to ask them about birth or residence. The scrutineers would only have to look at a small percentage of the athletes.

_It's a different gripe, but while we're on the subject of the burden of checking entries, the other missing piece of the puzzle would be for the competition checker to tell us when peoples' club memberships expired.  The current "three month grace period" means that the Competition Checker is basically lying to us in April, May and June, just when we need it most. It lets anyone challenge things and say "my club secretary will pay by June, honest!"  If the competition checker was clear on whether you had expired on 31st March 2017, or were paid until 31st March 2018, we'd all be able to exercise common sense.  Maybe a few athletes could be on a "watch list" and told they need to pay before the championships date, but most could be unambiguously cleared to compete without human intervention.
