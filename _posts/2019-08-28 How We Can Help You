## The Future of Athletics - Where is it heading?

Just before we start, no - we are not opening a discussion on the fear of the potential introduction of genetically or mechanically modified athletes beginning to have an impact on our sport!

Currently, OpenTrack are looking much closer to home and are simply aiming to modernise the amateur world of the sport we all love. Specifically, moving away from an over-reliance on pen & paper and digitising our competitions. Importantly, this goed hand-in-hand with minimising officials & volunteers' workloads, whilst providing a more interactive experience for spectators & athletes. Sounds good, right?!

## So, how can we help you?

## _1 Entries_

Our Entry System will provide a tailor-made microsite for your competition allowing team managers or individuals to swiftly and easily enter themselves into individual races or squads. This takes all the stress and urgency out of declarations!

Unlike many race entry sites, OpenTrack's has been created specifically with squad athletics, both XC & T&F, in mind. This means it can be completely tailored to your needs:

- Team & Squad Declarations on-the-go
	- Team Managers can make declarations using mobile friendly screens; easy to adjust to last minute drop outs at the venue!
- EA Registration checks
- Electronic payments direct to organisers' bank accounts
- Automatic reports for officials, team managers, volunteers, etc.
- Structured pricing

## _2 Competition Management & Results Display_

In a nutshell, the Competition Management System (CMS) is website based software designed to take all the pen, paper, time & stress out of the organistion and running of athletics competitions. It provides an individual and completely tailored microsite for your competition. Importantly, this is integrated into the Entry system meaning all athletes, events and any updates are incorporated seamlessly.

- Quick and easy "copy and paste" set-up
- Tailored configurable set-up: age group limitations, scoring, athlete check-in, etc.
- Integrated finish line technology
- Live as-it-happens results input, updates & displays
- Team Scores
- Automatic reports and start lists/field cards

## _3 Race Timing_

Whilst athletics participation increasing can only be a good thing, one of the issues with the escalation is the growing cost. Many events nowadays use chip timing for even simple races, such as XC. OpenTrack have a straightforward and manageable race timing software that you can use for free. Designed to work on phone and tablets this is great for keeping costs down whilst maintaining the detail and accuracy required. 

## Current Users

OpenTrack is currently used all across the UK for various competitions, ranging from XC & County Championships through to national events. 

Importantly, Welsh Athletics use it exclusively for all their major championships, whilst countries such as Norway, Estonia, Malta & Cyprus use it to manage their entire athletic database and competitions. 

"Have never spent less time doing results due to the automation"
	Darran Williams, Welsh Athletics, Competition Officer

"Moving forward this will help reduce the officials' time at the event and before"
	Welsh Official

"A game changer for commentary at events like Highgate . . . the technology used let us keep the audience fully in touch with leaders, splits and placings as the race unfolded"
	Nick Anderson, Night of 10000m PBs Commentator
