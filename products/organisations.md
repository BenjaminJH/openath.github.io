# Federations

At OpenTrack, we have experience of working directly with athletics organisations in most aspects of management and administration. Our main clients so far are the Estonian Athletics Federation and the British Masters’ Athletics Federation, which is the umbrella organization for masters’ athletics here in the UK. Working with European Athletics we are keen to offer federation management across the 51 member states.

Working closely with and listen to our client federations we feel we have produced a modern, web based single system that improves efficiency of federations and club volunteers alike.

Our federation management system has a modular design consisting of a core database, a membership management module and an entry component for nationally organised events. If a federation already has one of these components that they feel functions well, for example a core database, then we may be able to “plumb” that module into our system.

__Managing of Athletics Data__

The efficient running of athletics requires a central database. This must be the core of a federation management system. The Data must be accurate and be managed with controlled access. In line with our tiered access policy, individuals can see their data and make sure any errors are  corrected. The only other organisations with access will be their club and the federation. The data may only be used for the smooth running of athletics in that jurisdiction and we will keep to the standards recommended by European Athletics regarding the GDPR.

__Membership__

The membership status of any individual is accessible either through an API or Federation and club management screens. Example states could include:	
Licensed with expiry date
Lapsed with last valid date
Being processed

Individuals can check their own status and contact their club secretaries if they see any errors; this is normally the most efficient method of keeping data clean. Similarly the secretaries can use the “club view” to efficiently identify unlicensed athletes and forward the membership request to the federation. The federation has the overall view and can swiftly update and keep track of requests.

Approved third parties such as external race organisers can be allowed to access the membership status of a given athlete/athletes to let them to charge levies or restrict entries.

__Competitions__

The most basic requirement of a system is to list the championships and events run by the organisation. However, especially for closed events (where entry is limited to registered athletes) there is much more that can be done. Much of the wasted administration time for  events involves moving data from one system to another. We will already know the athletes’ details so a team manager can simply allocate identified runners into teams. Athletes, or just the relay leg order, can be changed on a mobile phone by the trackside.

The race organiser gets the most up to date teams, electronically, before the race starts.
Any relevant data such as gender and age group is checked and updated automatically into the event management module resulting in a more efficient and accurate match set up.

The final strand is results management and data-capture. We can uniquely identify each athlete so it is far simpler to update statistics databases and allow fans and athletes alike to see the results.

We would love to work with Federations across Europe, if you would like any more information please contact us at OpenTrack or feel free to browse our manuals.
