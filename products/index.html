<h1>OUR PRODUCTS</h1>

<h2>Who we are?</h2>
<p>We organise event mangement around team managers or club secretaries (admins) and athletes (users). Admins can create and manage events, and sign up their teams for events, saving them time, and giving validated data to race organisers.</p>
<p>We also hope to provide one place that everyone in the sport can go to find information and browse results, through our related Race Results website. Results are available in a desktop and mobile friendly format, as well as an automatically generated PDF. This makes it easier to complete and update race declarations online before or after the race.</p>

<!--<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>Making information open greatly benefits the sport and opens up possibilities to use the data to increase participation.</p>
<p>The Race Results database will also be crowdsourced, letting volunteers contribute local information.</p>
<p>We also aim to have open reference data, with unique IDs, on athletic organisations and other race-organising bodies, as well as clubs and venues.</p>

<h2 id="open-libraries">Open Libraries</h2>
<p>We will share useful building blocks for anyone building systems. This may include web front end elements, such as Javascript. We will also set up a separate page of useful components. Data will also be made available in Github pages.</p>

<h2 id="open-standards--json-and-excel">Open Standards:  JSON and Excel</h2>
<p>We will also suggest methods of representing the various packets of open data which could be stored and moved between systems:  clubs, membership lists, start lists, results of meetings. We will provide example files, and tools online to check their validity.</p>
<p>For each agreed JSON file format, we offer a common-sense Excel equivalent, so people can prepare data in a spreadsheet, paste it into a tool, and check its correctness.</p>-->


<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We offer a standard format for results (in flavours for races, relays, and T&amp;F), and a hosted results service. We are working on being able to display live results. Anyone who wants to upload results can use a link to embed in their website as an IFrame.</p>
