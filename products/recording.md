# Recording

Large scale races, with budgets to match, can afford chip timing systems. Our aim is to allow an athletic event to be run with just normal mobile smartphones. 

Using our web-based system, an event can be set up, and times recorded as long as there is access to 3G/4G or wi-fi. The system is intuitive enough that it has been used by “officials” between 10 and 70 years of age and from small club fixtures to the European Cross Country Championships.
 
We are adding field event software as well. With a device you can input your information right on the track. The days of running from the long jump pit to the clubhouse with a hand-written field card may soon be over. 
Phones and tablets may fail to connect to the internet, but the OpenTrack software will continue recording data and then resync once it's connected back up. 

For events like cross country there is no rekeying of information and, of course, if you used opentrack for the entries, the results will link to the athletes automatically through the bib number. Results can be on the web-site in real time with live team scores if required.
