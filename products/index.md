We are a new company that is aiming to bring technology into athletics. We want to improve the experience for competitors, officials and spectators alike. We are runners and want to see the grass roots sport benefit from the leaps forward in IT.

OpenTrack is a spin-off from ReportLab, who have been building and managing web solutions for demanding enterprise clients for 17 years, and lead the world in generating complex documents on demand.

We believe the hard-working officials should be spending their time on the track and not spending weeks dealing with entries, start lists and displaying results. Similarly, today’s competitors don’t want to have to wait for results, or take photos of "post-it"s on a wall.

Though we are a young organisation, we have successfully dealt with the entries, programmes and general clutter that goes with a County Athletics Championships for 6 counties with more than 3,000 athletes. 

We love all athletics, so have provided the technology for recording and running the Surrey Cross Country League (probably the premier XC league in the country, well we think so anyway).

If you would like us to help with any athletic events, please get in contact.
