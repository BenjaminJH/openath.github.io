# Entries

The benefits of OpenTrack start from the moment you need to enter data: we organizes all Athlete information in your event for you.

Switching to OpenTrack means getting rid of most of the paperwork, Nicola Fleet of Croydon Harriers, says she has 90% reduced paperwork – and she can do it all on holiday!

The system saves time for athlete and organiser alike. Not only do we take the credit card payments, OpenTrack also checks if athletes are registered with England Athletics and comply with their regulations, letting you focus on the race rather than the housekeeping. OpenTrack will even only let athletes sign up for events relevant for them.

We currently have more than 20,000 athletes registered on our system in the UK alone; for these athletes their details are filled in automatically. For a first time athlete, the entry system checks the fields as they are entered, PBs will have the correct format and our club picker ensures that the athletes club will exist and be spelt correctly.

The benefits are not just in terms of data accuracy and entry speed. Nicola also mentions that the young people in her club are more engaged, because they can see and talk about who's entered for what – no more secrecy means more fun.
