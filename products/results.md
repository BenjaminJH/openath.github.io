# Results

One of the biggest gripes of athletes, is the wait for the production of results. And they want them on the web, not a piece of paper stuck on a wall. The delays in the production of results are due to a few causes: having to retype data, not having a link between athletes details and their bib-number or fear and lack of understanding of the internet.
 
With our systems, there is no retyping, we have all the details and we will even give you a link or let you inbed the details on your own web-site.

A live feed enables you to broadcast the results online to anyone with access to the URL. Now anyone anywhere with an internet connection can see your results, improving the visibility of your event. Timing chips and photofinish are supported: OpenTrack can automatically fetch information from them to put into our servers. Do see our [openStandards](/open_systems/standards) work that is improving the transmission of athletics data globally.
