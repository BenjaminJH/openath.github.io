# Competition Management

Athletics events are complex; it is not just a matter of taking a few entries. We have helped organise some of the biggest and high profile meetings, from the Surrey County Champs with 1,000 athletes to the Night of the 10,000m which included the UK Championships. This complexity takes hours and hours of volunteer time, most of which is labouriously spent moving data around different spreadsheets or labelling numbers.
 
Once we have taken the entries individual bib numbers can be automatically assigned. We can produce Registration Sheets making organizing and distribution of bibs on the day of the event fast and efficient. Similarly, field cards and seeding sheets are produced instantly.

For cross country leagues we allow team managers to pick their squads on the day, using their mobile phones, and removing the need for last minute paper declarations. After the event, we calculate team scores and individual category winners; we have experience of perhaps some of the most complex scoring methods on the planet.
